OK components grouping for sizes adjustment, possibly column/row/cell styling - think about fluent interface for creating groups
 OK ignore row, col spans at first
 OK withGroup(int) withGroupX/Y(int) treeHashMap to store groups - prioritized
 OK withGroupUnassigned() withGroupX/YUnassigned() for removing from group
 OK withGroup(n) = withGroupX(n).withGroupY(n)
DONE alignment to baseline - first try how it actually works
 OK LEFT-RIGHT names OK (insets also respect orientation)
 OK respect Swing's componentOrientation -> replace absolute positioning with relative/baseline
 NOTE rename GBT Orientation to direction
 OK baseline on demand as withBaseline(boolean) with default = false - baseline switch applies relative or baseline positioning respectively
 DONE test recursive component orientation -> Swing's componentOrientation is not transitive
 OK unittests for baseline and sizeGroups in spec()
TODO unittests for SizeGroupSupport
TODO unittests for anchor & baseline to constraints - fill and anchor
OK refactor the code to use newest features, maybe get rid of specWithFillX at all -> spec with Fill stays
FIXME VerticalOrientationFormDemo - scroll not working
TODO think about text align in label, beware of vertical
OK withBaseline(false) by default and withBaseline() with default true param
TODO all anchors respecting baseline (?)
OK test that decoration with scroll shows scroll after shrinking
TODO .add(label, field[, spec]/componentCommand) can have additional ":"
TODO test baselines of panels with text fields, also when baseline component is not first
TODO try many examples... e.g. labeled chkb group no wrapped with panel
