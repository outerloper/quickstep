OK think about text align in label, beware of vertical -> NO, if you want to have your labels right-aligned, specify it in ComponentFactory
OK .add(label, field[, spec]/componentCommand) can have additional ":"
OK move handling mnemonics to factory -> not in this "release"
OK factory starts to be golden hammer, think about splitting it -> panel appearance and wrapping build method
OK resizable panel without components - test getting resizable behavior
