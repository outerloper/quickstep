OK components grouping for sizes adjustment, possibly column/row/cell styling - think about fluent interface for creating groups
 OK ignore row, col spans at first
 OK withGroup(int) withGroupX/Y(int) treeHashMap to store groups - prioritized
 OK withGroupUnassigned() withGroupX/YUnassigned() for removing from group
 OK withGroup(n) = withGroupX(n).withGroupY(n)
DONE alignment to baseline - first try how it actually works
 OK LEFT-RIGHT names OK (insets also respect orientation)
 OK respect Swing's componentOrientation -> replace absolute positioning with relative/baseline
 OK rename GBT Orientation to direction
 OK baseline on demand as withBaseline(boolean) with default = false - baseline switch applies relative or baseline positioning respectively
 DONE test recursive component orientation -> Swing's componentOrientation is not transitive
 OK unittests for baseline and sizeGroups in spec()
OK unittests for SizeGroupSupport
OK unittests for anchor & baseline to constraints - fill and anchor
OK refactor the code to use newest features, maybe get rid of specWithFillX at all -> spec with Fill stays
OK VerticalOrientationFormDemo - scroll not working
TODO think about text align in label, beware of vertical
OK withBaseline(false) by default and withBaseline() with default true param
OK all anchors respecting baseline (?) -> NO
OK test that decoration with scroll shows scroll after shrinking
TODO .add(label, field[, spec]/componentCommand) can have additional ":"
OK test baselines of panels with text fields, also when baseline component is not first -> we don't care when first component has no baseline
OK try many examples... e.g. labeled chkb group no wrapped with panel -> mnemonics work fine, baseline done
