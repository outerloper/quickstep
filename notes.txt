TODO components grouping for sizes adjustment, possibly column/row/cell styling - think about fluent interface for creating groups
 NOTE ignore row, col spans at first
 NOTE withGroup(int) withGroupX/Y(int) treeHashMap to store groups - prioritized
 NOTE withGroupUnassigned() withGroupX/YUnassigned() for removing from group
 NOTE withGroup(n) = withGroupX(n).withGroupY(n)
DONE alignment to baseline - first try how it actually works
 OK LEFT-RIGHT names OK (insets also respect orientation)
 OK respect Swing's componentOrientation -> replace absolute positioning with relative/baseline
 NOTE rename GBT Orientation to direction
 OK baseline on demand as withBaseline(boolean) with default = false - baseline switch applies relative or baseline positioning respectively
 DONE test recursive component orientation -> Swing's componentOrientation is not transitive
 TODO unittests
TODO refactor the code to use newest features, maybe get rid of specWithFillX at all
FIXME VerticalOrientationFormDemo - scroll not working

TODO test that decoration with scroll shows scroll after shrinking
